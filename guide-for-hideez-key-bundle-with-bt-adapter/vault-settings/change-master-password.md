# Changing master password

{% hint style="warning" %}
A master password is required to perform some actions with Hideez Key:

* authorization (a PIN code's analogue in some cases)
* to configure Access settings
* to change the PIN code

It cannot be restored, so take its creation seriously. If you forget it, the only way to restore it is[ to clean HK (Wipe) completely. ](../interface/service-operations/wipe.md)
{% endhint %}

To change the master password, click on the **Change master password** button in the **Vault settings** section. Enter the current master password, the new one (twice), and click the **Confirm** button.
