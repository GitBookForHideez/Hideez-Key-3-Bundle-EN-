The "**Automatically start uploading device firmware**" checkbox is disabled by default. Make it active if you are sure you need to update the firmware. If you are unsure, you can leave this box blank, check your current firmware version, and then click the **Update** button if necessary.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using Hideez Key that has never been paired with your PC, you will need to confirm the operation by pressing the Hideez Key's button while it is flashing green to start the firmware update process. If you do not press the button while it is flashing, the Hideez Client application will not be able to pair with the Hideez Key.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not press the button while the key is flashing green, pairing will not occur and the Device Maintenance Application will not be able to work with the Hideez key. To re-pair, you need to repeat a short press.
{% endhint %}
