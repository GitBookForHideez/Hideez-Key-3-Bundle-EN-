* [Tap & Go](vault-settings/configure-the-methods-of-locking-and-unlocking-the-pc-proximity-settings.md#tap-and-go)
* [Wait for user activity](vault-settings/configure-the-methods-of-locking-and-unlocking-the-pc-proximity-settings.md#wait-for-user-activity)
* [Automatic unlock](vault-settings/configure-the-methods-of-locking-and-unlocking-the-pc-proximity-settings.md#automatic-unlock)
