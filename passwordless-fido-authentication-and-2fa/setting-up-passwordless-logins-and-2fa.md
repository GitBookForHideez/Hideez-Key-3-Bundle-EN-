# Setting up passwordless logins and 2FA

Once you have paired Hideez Key with your devices, you can set up passwordless authentication or two-factor authentication on websites supporting FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards.

FIDO specifications are currently supported by Google [Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/chrome-70-beta-shape-detection-web.html), Mozilla [Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/05/09/firefox-gets-down-to-business-and-its-personal/), Microsoft [Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/07/30/introducing-web-authentication-microsoft-edge/) and Apple [Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/8517/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-71/) web browsers.

You will need to enable the passwordless sign-in method with a security key for each app and website you want to use it with.
{% endhint %}

### Enable passwordless 2FA with the Hideez Key

Follow the steps below to enable FIDO U2F authentication:

1\) Log into the account you would like to use your Hideez Key with and navigate to Security settings.&#x20;

2\) Typically, there is an option for enabling 2FA and registering your security key. Follow the on-screen instructions to register the key.&#x20;

3\) Next time you log into your account the system will request you to connect your security key and confirm your authentication.

To set up passwordless two-factor authentication in Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and/or a host of other services, no additional software is needed. You can follow the instructions of any U2F-supporting services to use the Hideez Key as your second factor.&#x20;
