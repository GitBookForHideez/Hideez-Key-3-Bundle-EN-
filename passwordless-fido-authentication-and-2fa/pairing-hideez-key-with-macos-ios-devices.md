iOS operating system allows use of the hardware security keys for passwordless logins into accounts based on the [FIDO U2F and FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/) standards. Services that support FIDO login methods include Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox, and [other ](https://hideez.com/pages/supported-services)platforms.

**Minimum System Requirements:**

* iOS 13.3 or higher

Physical FIDO2-compliant security keys are supported by the Safari Web browser (version 13.0.4 or higher) and third-party applications (such as Gmail, Facebook, etc.) on iOS.

You don't need to pair the Hideez Key with your iOS device, you only have to follow the desired services official guidelines.
