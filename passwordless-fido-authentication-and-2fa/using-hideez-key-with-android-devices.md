# Pairing Hideez Key with Android devices

{% hint style="warning" %}
A Password Manager functionality is available ONLY on Windows 10/11.
{% endhint %}

The Android operating system (version 7.0 and higher) allows the use of hardware security keys for login to accounts based on the [FIDO U2F](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/) standard. Services that support this standard include Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox, and [other](https://hideez.com/pages/supported-services).&#x20;

The device can be connected to your Android devices via Bluetooth connection [(Hideez Key 3) ](https://hideez.com/products/hideez-key-3)or via Bluetooth / NFC / micro-USB connection [(Hideez Key 4)](https://hideez.com/products/hideez-key-4).&#x20;

Below is a demonstration of setting up a two-factor authentication (2FA) for Google account on Android devices:

After the Hideez Key has been successfully paired with your computer, you can proceed to [setting up a passwordless login](setting-up-passwordless-logins-and-2fa.md) to the desired accounts.
